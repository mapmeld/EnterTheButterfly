# Enter the Butterfly

My favorite map projection is

and it's a very cool thing to have in D3.

I was wondering if I could make a zoomable map like we have for Mercator. Specifically:

* Clicking on a region should zoom me into that area
* The map should rotate so that north is up for the selected area.

This repo is what I have so far.

First zoom into North America:
